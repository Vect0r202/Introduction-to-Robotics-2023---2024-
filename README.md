Robotics Course Homework Repository - University of Bucharest

This GitHub repository is dedicated to organizing and managing your homework assignments for the Robotics course at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest. It provides a structured platform for storing, tracking, and sharing your work throughout the course.

🌟Key Features🌟


📚Homework Structure📚

Each homework assignment is organized in a dedicated folder, making it easy to locate and manage individual tasks.

🎯Requirements🎯

Within each homework folder, you will find a detailed document outlining the specific requirements and objectives for that assignment. This document helps you understand what is expected for successful completion.

🧩Implementation Details🧩

Accompanying the requirements document is a comprehensive guide that provides implementation details, guidelines, and any relevant theory or concepts you should consider while working on the assignment.

💻Code💻

Your code implementations are stored within the repository, ensuring version control and collaboration with your peers. Code files can be organized by homework task or included in subfolders for better organization.

📷Media Files📷

To enhance your documentation, the repository supports the inclusion of image files and videos. You can use these to demonstrate your robot's performance, visualize results, and provide clear explanations in your homework.

 "Pseudo-Smart Environment Monitor and Logger" involves developing a system using Arduino to monitor environmental data. Key features include using various sensors like an Ultrasonic Sensor and an LDR (Light-Dependent Resistor), logging data into EEPROM, and providing feedback via an RGB LED. The project emphasizes integrating sensor readings, memory management, and Serial Communication, with a focus on building a user-interactive menu. The assignment also includes guidelines on EEPROM usage, sensor calibration, and error handling in Serial Communication, aiming to create a versatile and responsive environmental monitoring system. 🌡️🔊💡🖥️🔧
