Robotics Course Homework Repository - University of Bucharest

This GitHub repository is dedicated to organizing and managing your homework assignments for the Robotics course at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest. It provides a structured platform for storing, tracking, and sharing your work throughout the course.

ðŸŒŸKey FeaturesðŸŒŸ


ðŸ“šHomework StructureðŸ“š

Each homework assignment is organized in a dedicated folder, making it easy to locate and manage individual tasks.

ðŸŽ¯RequirementsðŸŽ¯

Within each homework folder, you will find a detailed document outlining the specific requirements and objectives for that assignment. This document helps you understand what is expected for successful completion.

ðŸ§©Implementation DetailsðŸ§©

Accompanying the requirements document is a comprehensive guide that provides implementation details, guidelines, and any relevant theory or concepts you should consider while working on the assignment.

ðŸ’»CodeðŸ’»

Your code implementations are stored within the repository, ensuring version control and collaboration with your peers. Code files can be organized by homework task or included in subfolders for better organization.

ðŸ“·Media FilesðŸ“·

To enhance your documentation, the repository supports the inclusion of image files and videos. You can use these to demonstrate your robot's performance, visualize results, and provide clear explanations in your homework.


Homework - 2

In this robotics lab assignment, you will use an Arduino microcontroller to independently control the red, green, and blue colors of an RGB LED using three potentiometers. By adjusting the potentiometer knobs, you can vary the intensity of each color, allowing you to create a wide range of colors. This assignment focuses on analog input and output interfacing, providing hands-on experience with color control.
